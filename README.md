## Anthony Mascari | ML Sample Project ##
This project was created by me as a capstone project.

- All visualizations were created using matplot/seaborn.

- The model was created using the XGBoost library.

- The API was written with FastAPI.

- The front end of the application was an experiement with HTMX.

- I performed all design and coding on this project with data
  collection being the only part I did not do on my own.

The raw data was acquired from Kaggle and originally curated by:
Hummamm Qaasim
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hummaamqaasim/jobs-in-data

Data visualizations, documentation and explainations of the 
'business problem' being addressed by this project are available
in the 'Docs' folder.

If you are looking to run a copy on your localhost, please find
the necessary files inside the 'Dist' folder.

Thank you!
